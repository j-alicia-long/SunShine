# Web Scrape for Data
Due to limited access to employee datasets, we web-scraped social.vmware.com for POD community membership data. This was done using [Selenium for Python](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/).

## Group Membership Lists
- Scraped member data from VMware social POD community pages
- Involves bypassing Workspace ONE login/authentication
- Note: Cannot scrape again without access
