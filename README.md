## VMAware: A D&I Hub
We would like for VMware to be at the forefront of the movement in diversifying talent across the company's workforce. To propel VMware forward in promoting Diversity & Inclusion (D&I), we are building a web application that will leverage data visualization to analyze the diversity of backgrounds & perspectives across VMware employees.

**VMAware** is a new D&I hub where employees can view live data on the company's progress towards its D&I goals each quarter, and provide continuous feedback to VMware through sentiment analysis surveys. Users can also view D&I POD engagement statistics, including membership and event attendance.

Behind the scenes, we will provide recommendations for HR and team managers on how to diversify talent across teams in VMware. We hope to inform their decisions on creating outreach and recruitment programs for under-represented minorities, and facilitating employee relocation between different teams, business units, or office locations.
